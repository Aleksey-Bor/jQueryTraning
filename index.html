      /*Query has some easy-to-implement effects to create animations.
The hide() and show() methods are used to hide and show the selected elements.
The toggle() method is used to toggle between hiding and showing elements.


Similar to the hide/show methods, jQuery provides the fadeInfadeOut methods, which fade an element in and out of visibility.
Just like the toggle() method switches between hiding and showing, the fadeToggle() method fades in and out.

Another method used for fading is fadeTo(), which allows fading to a given opacity (value between 0 and 1). For example: $("div").fadeTo(1500, 0.7);

The slideUp() and slideDown() methods are used to create a sliding effect on elements.
Again, similar to the previous toggle methods, the slideToggle() method switches between the sliding effects and can take two optional parameters: speed and callback.*/
